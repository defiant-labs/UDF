INSTALLATION:

1. Apply 'driver.patch' to your source tree and rebuild your kernel.  This adds
a new ioctl used to read session information from the disc.  It will also add
udf2 to the list of external mount programs in the mount(8) command.  Unless you
also ran installworld, also copy 'sys/sys/udfio.h' to 
'/usr/include/sys/udfio.h'. (The file system will work with decreased 
functionality without this step.)

2. To build and install UDF2 file system run "make && make install" in the
project's directory.  This will install the following four files: 'udf2.ko', 
'udf2_iconv.ko', 'mount_udf2', and 'mount_udf2.8.gz'.

REMAINING WORK ITEMS:
 * Extensive testing
