INSTALLATION:
1. Rebuild and install kernel with 'driver.patch'.  This will enable mount_udf2
to read session information from DVD devices.  CD devices are not supported 
yet.  (The file system will work with decreased functionality without this
step.)

2. Build and install UDF2 file system. Run "make && make install" in 'udf2', 
'udf2_iconv', and then 'mount_udf2'.  

NOTE: The 'driver' directory does not contain anything to be build.  It was 
used when developing the 'driver.patch' file.

REMAINING WORK ITEMS:
 * Add support for CD devices to driver.patch
 * Extensive testing, including with metadata partition disk.
 * Clean up messages and functionality in mount_udf2.
 * Test
