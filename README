INSTALLATION:
1. Rebuild and install kernel with 'driver.patch'.  This will enable mount_udf2
to read session information from DVD devices.  CD devices are not supported 
yet.  (The file system will work with decreased functionality without this
step.)

2. Build and install UDF2 file system. Run "make && make install" in 'udf2', 
'udf2_iconv', and then 'mount_udf2'.  

REMAINING WORK ITEMS:
 * Add support for CD devices to driver.patch
 * Extensive testing, including with metadata partition disk.
 * Check length of vat before allocating memory.
 * Fix udf_get_node_id and udf_get_node_longad.
