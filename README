INSTALLATION:
1. Rebuild and install kernel with 'driver.patch'.  This will enable mount_udf2
to read session information from DVD drives. (The file system will work with 
decreased functionality without this step.)

2. Build and install UDF2 file system. Run "make && make install" in 'udf2', 
'udf2_iconv', and then 'mount_udf2'.  

REMAINING WORK ITEMS:
 * Add support for CD drives to driver.patch
 * Extensive testing, including with metadata partition disk.
